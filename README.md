# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## DESCRIPTION

A starter code was given and the challenge was to refactor the given codes. Semantic codes were used as a replacement for non-semantic elements to make it more accessible for users. When the source code is viewed, semantic HTML elements are visible. Icon and image elements have an alt attribute.
Heading attributes are in sequential order. The CSS selectors and properties are organized to follow semantic structures. When viewing CSS, comments are placed to keep organized. Created project through Github by creating a new repository using git commands: git add -A, git commit -m"". and git push origin main.
